- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
Before try to writing inheritance code myself, I'm a little confused about how it works and implemented. But this assignment really helps me to know how inheritance can reduces repetitive codes and makes the coding of different classes of objects but sharing similiar characteristics much easier. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
After checking the rubric, I think my code met all the requirement. I would recommend that go over the one card example in class which is really helpful when doing this assignment.
